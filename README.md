# Radar Reprojection Mapping Improves Obstacle Avoidance in Mobile Robots with an Unsteered Radar Sensor
Master's Thesis

### Abstract
Mobile indoor robots mostly rely on lidar and vision sensors to remotely detect obstacles in
their path. These sensors have trouble detecting some common real-world obstacles like
transparent surfaces and chair legs. Recent affordable near-range miniature radar sensors
enable new solutions.  
This thesis introduces a simple solution for a radar sensor being moving through a static
environment without the need for beamforming or a mechanically scanning radar. The idea
is put to test in experiments with an Omniradar FMCW radar mounted on a Kobuki robot
platform. A comparison with lidar and RGBD sensors shows how promising the setup is for
mapping unstructured static environments.
