@article{Cho2017,
abstract = {This article presents a new signal processing method of estimation of direction of arrival using the phase difference between sensors. The new method is essentially a narrow-band technique for automotive radar. A delay of the reception time is caused by the physical gap between sensors in the incident signals to the sensor arrays, and it results in a phase difference between input signals. The new method predicts the ideal phase value and the phase value of the input signal. The point that minimizes the phase error for every sensor is estimated as direction of arrival. The simulation result shows that the new method offers significantly improved estimation resolution and direction-of-arrival estimation compared to conventional methods.},

In this paper, a combination of two algorithms is presented. A basic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm relying on simple indoor features is used to explore the environment and build a map. This algorithm is augmented by an object-recognition (OR) algorithm that is capable of recognizing and localizing complex shapes. These shapes can be used to improve the map resolution accuracy and resolve ambiguities. First tests using an m-sequence UWB Radar indicate the feasibility of this concept.},

abstract = {An analytical time-domain (TD) solution based on an established frequency-domain (FD) transmission model is presented for transmission of ultrawideband (UWB) signals through low-loss dielectric obstacles, in a microcellular and indoor propagation environment. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the FD transmission model and presents a computationally more efficient direct TD transmission solution. Various obstacles considered in this paper include dielectric wedge and rectangular building with homogeneous, isotropic, and low-loss dielectric characteristics. Novel TD transmission coefficients, for transmission through an interface between air and a low-loss dielectric medium, are proposed for both hard and soft polarizations. The proposed TD solution is validated against the numerical inverse fast Fourier transform of the exact FD (IFFT-FD) solution and the results are found to be in very good agreement with each other. The computational efficiency achieved through the proposed TD solution is demonstrated by comparing its computation time with that of the exact IFFT-FD solution.},

abstract = {A system for building a feature-based map of an unknown indoor environment is proposed. We consider emergency scenarios where smoke and dust block the vision so that camera-based systems and laser range finders are not operable. In this kind of situation, ultra-wideband (UWB) radar is a good alternative. We use a bat-type UWB radar system composed of one transmitter and two receivers arranged in a fixed linear array. Time-of-flight measurements are taken between the transmitter and the receivers. The environment is reconstructed from impulse responses by extracting information on different features like walls, edges and corners. These features can be used as landmarks to navigate. The solution we present works by dividing the problem into three different parts and solving them: Tracking of the bat pose and localization of already detected landmarks; data association to single out measurements originating from the detected landmarks; and detection of new landmarks from the remaining measurements. By combining solutions to these three subtasks, a computationally cheap, precise algorithm for feature-based indoor mapping is obtained. Tests using real life data were performed to confirm the feasibility of the approach.},

abstract = {Figure 1—Through-wall Capture of the Human Figure. The sensor is placed behind a wall. It emits low-power radio signals. The signals traverse the wall and reflect off different objects in the environment, including the human body. Due to the physics of radio reflections, at every point in time, the sensor captures signal reflections from only a subset of the human body parts. We capture the human figure by analyzing multiple reflection snapshots across time and combining their information to recover the various limbs of the human body. Abstract We present RF-Capture, a system that captures the human figure – i.e., a coarse skeleton – through a wall. RF-Capture tracks the 3D positions of a person's limbs and body parts even when the per-son is fully occluded from its sensor, and does so without placing any markers on the subject's body. In designing RF-Capture, we built on recent advances in wireless research, which have shown that certain radio frequency (RF) signals can traverse walls and re-flect off the human body, allowing for the detection of human mo-tion through walls. In contrast to these past systems which abstract the entire human body as a single point and find the overall location of that point through walls, we show how we can reconstruct var-ious human body parts and stitch them together to capture the hu-man figure. We built a prototype of RF-Capture and tested it on 15 subjects. Our results show that the system can capture a represen-tative human figure through walls and use it to distinguish between various users.},

abstract = {Introduction The fi rst popular standards for wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11a and b) were designed primarily to serve the needs of a laptop PC in the home and offi ce, and later to allow connectivity " on the road " in airports, hotels, Internet cafes, and shopping malls. Their main function was to provide a link to a wired broadband connec-tion for Web browsing and email. Since the speed of the broadband connection was the limiting factor, a relatively low-speed wireless connection was suffi cient – 802.11a provided up to 54 Mb/s at 5 GHz, and 802.11b up to 11 Mb/s at 2.4 GHz, both in unlicensed spectrum bands. To minimize interference from other equipment, both used forms of spread-spectrum transmission and were heavily encoded. A later revision of the standard, 802.11g in 2003, consolidated use in the 2.4 GHz band but maintained the maximum data rate at 54 Mb/s. However, by the same time, new usage models with the need for higher throughput had been recognized: data sharing amongst connected devices in the home or small offi ce and wireless printing as examples. A study project was set up which produced 802.11n in 2009. As well as improving the maximum single-channel data rate to over 100 Mb/s, this new standard introduced MIMO (multiple input, multiple output or spatial streaming), where up to 4 separate physical transmit and receive antennas carry independent data that is aggregated in the modulation/demodulation process. Agilent's measurement and application expertise helps you anticipate increasing technical and operational complexities so you can accelerate your ability to achieve both engineering and business goals. 2 Today, there are further usage models, summarized in Table 1, that require even higher data throughput to support today's " unwired office " . Table 1. New WLAN usage models. Category Usage Model Wireless Display • Desktop storage and display • Projection to TV or projector in conference room or auditorium • In-room gaming • Streaming from camcorder to display • Professional HDTV outside broadcast pickup Distribution of HDTV • Video streaming around the home • Intra-large-vehicle applications (e.g. airplane, ferry) • Wireless networking for office • Remote medical assistance Rapid upload/download • Rapid file transfer/sync • Picture-by-picture viewing • Airplane docking (manifests, fuel, catering, . .) • Downloading movie content to mobile device • Police surveillance data transfer Backhaul • Multi-media mesh backhaul • Point-to-point backhaul Outdoor campus / auditorium • Video demo/tele-presence in auditorium • Public safety mesh (incident presence) Manufacturing floor • Automation To cater for these, two new IEEE project groups aimed at providing " Very High Throughput " (VHT) were established in late 2008. Working Group TGac is currently putting the finishing touches to 802.11ac, an extension of 802.11n, providing a minimum of 500 Mbit/s single link and 1 Gbit/s overall throughput, running in the 5 GHz band. Working Group TGad has since completed its work with the publication of 802.11ad, providing up to 6.75 Gbps throughput using approximately 2 GHz of spectrum at 60 GHz over a short range. (60 GHz transmission suffers from large attenuation through physical barriers.) Bearing in mind the number of existing devices, backward compatibility with existing standards using the same frequency range is a " must " . The goal is for all the 802.11 series of standards to be backward compat-ible, and for 802.11ac and ad to be compatible at the Medium Access Control (MAC) or Data Link layer, and differ only in physical layer characteristics (see Figure 1). Devices could then have three radios: 2.4 GHz for general use which may suffer from interference, 5 GHz for more robust and higher speed applications, and 60 GHz for ultra-high-speed within a room – and support session switching amongst them. IEEE 802.11ad-2012 was published in December 2012 and products based on this technology are now commercially available. 802.11ac is scheduled to be finalized by February 2014, and devices complying with the draft 11ac standard have already been announced.

abstract = {—Low-cost sensors for simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) on robotic platforms (e.g. miniature sonar or radar) are susceptible to false and missed detections. This paper presents an occupancy-grid algorithm for SLAM which deals with this type of imperfect sensor measurements using the random finite set theoretical framework. The solution is formulated as a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter, where the robot pose is estimated using the sequential Monte Carlo method, while the map (occupancy-grid) update is calculated analytically. The particle filter is implemented using an adaptive importance sampling scheme with progressive correction. Results obtained in numerical simulations demonstrate a robust performance in the presence of false detections and low probability of detection.},

abstract = {Supervision of human vital signs has always been an essential part in healthcare. Nowadays there is a strong interest in contact-less monitoring methods as they operate less static and offer higher flexibility to the people observed. Recent industrial development enabled radar functionality to be packed in single-chip solutions, decreasing application complexity and speeding up designs. Within this thesis, a vital sign radar prototype has been developed utilising a recently released 60GHz frequency modulated continous wave single-chip radar. The electronics development has been focused on compactness and high system integration. Special attention has been given to the onboard analogue signal filtering and digital data preprocessing. The resulting prototype radar is then tested and evaluated using test scenarios with increasing difficulty. The final experiments prove that the radar is capable of tracking human respiration rate and heartbeat simultaneously from a distance of 1m. It can be concluded that modern radar devices may be significantly miniaturised for e.g. portable operation while offering a wide variety of application possibilities including vital sign monitoring.},

Due to the variety of methods of analysis and design, and the different antenna structures available, the applications covered in this book are made to some of the most basic and practical antenna configurations. Among these antenna configurations are linear dipoles; loops; arrays; broadband antennas; aperture antennas; horns; microstrip antennas; and reflector antennas. The text contains sufficient mathematical detail to enable undergraduate and beginning graduate students in electrical engineering and physics to follow the flow of analysis and design. Readers should have a basic knowledge of undergraduate electromagnetic theory, including Maxwell's equations and the wave equation, introductory physics, and differential and integral calculus.},

abstract = {The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), as part of a mission and customer funded exploratory program, has developed a new low-frequency, ultra-wideband (UWB) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for forward imaging to support the Army's vision of an autonomous navigation system for robotic ground vehicles. These unmanned vehicles, equipped with an array of imaging sensors, will be tasked to help detect man-made obstacles such as concealed targets, enemy minefields, and booby traps, as well as other natural obstacles such as ditches, and bodies of water. The ability of UWB radar technology to help detect concealed objects has been documented in the past and could provide an important obstacle avoidance capability for autonomous navigation systems, which would improve the speed and maneuverability of these vehicles and consequently increase the survivability of the U. S. forces on the battlefield. One of the primary features of the radar is the ability to collect and process data at combat pace in an affordable, compact, and lightweight package. To achieve this, the radar is based on the synchronous impulse reconstruction (SIRE) technique where several relatively slow and inexpensive analog-to-digital (A/D) converters are used to sample the wide bandwidth of the radar signals. We conducted an experiment this winter at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) to support the phenomenological studies of the backscatter from positive and negative obstacles for autonomous robotic vehicle navigation, as well as the detection of concealed targets of interest to the Army. In this paper, we briefly describe the UWB SIRE radar and the test setup in the experiment. We will also describe the signal processing and the forward imaging techniques used in the experiment. Finally, we will present imagery of man-made obstacles such as barriers, concertina wires, and mines.},

abstract = {Indoor navigation especially in unknown areas is a real challenge. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology provides a solution. However SLAM as currently based on optical sensors, is unsuitable in vision denied areas, which are for example encountered by first responders. Radar can be used to overcome this drawback, however no fully suitable solutions are reported yet. This paper presents radar SLAM technology for indoor use and shows its operational applicability. Modern electronically scanning antenna technology is used to obtain a portable radar front-end that in combination with FMCW processing provides a high resolution 2D radar image. The radar image is fed to a mapping and localization algorithm. An iterative closest point algorithm is used to determine the radar location and movement, whereas a particle filter optimizes measurement performance. The SLAM radar is evaluated under test conditions to reveal its mapping capabilities and under operational conditions in the EU-DITSEF project, to reveal its added value for human operators. The radar provides a reliable map and location functionality.},

Data-adaptive methods such as minimum-entropy autofocus have shown promising results for estimating phase errors under conditions of low SNR, low image contrast, and substantial phase errors. However, since they involve iteratively minimizing a non-quadratic objective function, it remains an open question under what conditions these algorithms converge and if the resulting solution is op-timal. In this paper we present an iterative algorithm for minimum-entropy autofocus developed using techniques col-lectively known as Optimization Transfer or MM-Algorithms that is guaranteed to converge.

abstract = {Object recognition, localization and imaging capabilities of ultra-wideband signals are demonstrated in this contribution. Resembling a bat, the experimental setup comprises one transmitter and two receivers. Instead of ultrasound, electromagnetic ultra-wideband (UWB) signals are used to recognize and localize features of the surroundings like e.g. walls, edges or corners. Each feature corresponds to a hypothesis on the dominant reflection and scattering conditions described in terms of simple ray-tracing relationships. The hypothesis matching best the propagation time measurements is picked to identify and localize the feature in front of the moving UWB bat. Henceforth these features could be used as landmarks for bat navigation. Both, position and attitude of the UWB bat could be continuously updated based on a map of landmarks. This kind of navigation is well-known in the literature as simultaneous localization and mapping. Since position and attitude of the UWB bat are tracked, an image of the vicinity in front of the UWB bat can be compiled by superimposing the impulse responses recorded at the various locations. This contribution describes the pivotal elements to this approach: feature recognition and localization as well as bat-type imaging.},

abstract = {Rotating radar sensors are perception systems rarely used in mobile robotics. This paper is concerned with the use of a mobile ground-based panoramic radar sensor which is able to deliver both distance and velocity of multiple targets in its surrounding. The consequence of using such a sensor in high speed robotics is the appearance of both geometric and Doppler velocity distortions in the collected data. These effects are, in the majority of studies, ignored or considered as noise and then corrected based on proprioceptive sensors or localization systems. Our purpose is to study and use data distortion and Doppler effect as sources of information in order to estimate the vehicle's displacement. The linear and angular velocities of the mobile robot are estimated by analyzing the distortion of the measurements provided by the panoramic Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, called IMPALA. Without the use of any proprioceptive sensor, these estimates are then used to build the trajectory of the vehicle and the radar map of outdoor environments. In this paper, radar-only localization and mapping results are presented for a ground vehicle moving at high speed.},

abstract = {There is an increased interest in contact-less vital sign monitoring methods as they offer higher flexibility to the individual being observed. Recent industrial development enabled radar functionality to be packed in single-chip solutions, decreasing application complexity and speeding up designs. Within this paper, a vital sign radar has been developed utilizing a recently released 60GHz frequency modulated continuous wave single-chip radar in combination with 3D-printed quasi-optics. The electronics development has been focused on compactness and high system integration using a low cost design process. The final experiments prove that the radar is capable of tracking human respiration rate and heartbeat at the same time from a distance of 1m.},

In the presented collision avoidance scenario it can be used even without any vision or Lidar based sensor system. Our sensor is capable of detecting humans and objects made of conductive and non-conductive materials in short range surrounding of the robot. The sensing range can be tailored according to the needs of the application and robot. The sensor front end of the capacitive proximity sensor provides full flexibility to be attached on rounded surfaces. Due to the sensing principle it can even be mounted underneath the surface. In addition, the presented capacitive proximity sensor is fully supported by the Robot Operating System (ROS) to be utilized on a broad variety of robot platforms.},

@article{Heckel2016,
abstract = {In this paper, we study the identification of a time-varying linear system from its response to a known input signal. More specifically, we consider systems whose response to the input signal is given by a weighted superposition of delayed and Doppler-shifted versions of the input. This problem arises in a multitude of applications such as wireless communications and radar imaging. Due to practical con-straints, the input signal has finite bandwidth B, and the received signal is observed over a finite time interval of length T only. This gives rise to a delay and Doppler resolution of 1/B and 1/T. We show that this resolution limit can be overcome, i.e., we can exactly recover the continuous delay–Doppler pairs and the corresponding attenuation factors, by solving a convex optimization problem. This result holds pro-vided that the distance between the delay–Doppler pairs is at least 2.37/B in time or 2.37/T in frequency. Furthermore, this result allows the total number of delay–Doppler pairs to be linear up to a log-factor in BT, the dimensionality of the response of the system, and thereby the limit for identifiability. Stated differently, we show that we can estimate the time–frequency components of a signal that is S-sparse in the continuous dictionary of time–frequency shifts of a random window function, from a number of measurements that is linear up to a log-factor in S.},

It requires no a priori knowledge of the surrounding and no additional infrastructure. A feature based approach with an underlying state space model is used. The data association problem is solved by grouping in the measurement space. Tests with simulated and measured data show that an accuracy up to 10cm can be achieved so far.},

abstract = {In array signal processing, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation has been studied for decades. Many algo- rithms have been proposed and their performance has been studied thoroughly. Yet, most of these works are focused on the asymptotic case of a large number of snapshots. In automotive radar applications like driver assistance systems, however, only a small number of snapshots of the radar sen- sor array or, in the worst case, a single snapshot is available for DOA estimation. In this paper, we investigate and compare different DOA estimators with respect to their single snapshot performance. The main focus is on the estimation accuracy and the angular resolution in multi-target scenarios including difficult situ- ations like correlated targets and large target power differ- ences. We will show that some algorithms lose their ability to resolve targets or do not work properly at all. Other so- phisticated algorithms do not showa superior performance as expected. It turns out that the deterministic maximum likeli- hood estimator is a good choice under these hard conditions.},

This unique book demonstrates probabilistic radar models and detection algorithms specifically for robotic land vehicles. It examines grid based robotic mapping with radar based on measurement likelihood estimation. You find detailed coverage of simultaneous localization and Map Building (SLAM) an area referred to as the Holy Grail of autonomous robotic research. The book derives an extended Kalman Filter SLAM algorithm which exploits the penetrating ability of radar. This algorithm allows for the observation of visually occluded objects, as well as the usual directly observed objects, which contributes to a robots position and the map state update. Moreover, you discover how the Random Finite Set (RFS) provides a more appropriate approach for representing radar based maps than conventional frameworks.},

The system consists of data acquisition, signal processing, image reconstruction and image processing blocks. For image reconstruction, we propose a simple method which is significantly faster when compared to classical time-domain back projection (TDBP).

In this paper, we present an open-source framework to generate volumetric 3D environment models. Our mapping approach is based on octrees and uses probabilistic occupancy estimation. It explicitly represents not only occupied space, but also free and unknown areas. Furthermore, we propose an octree map compression method that keeps the 3D models compact. Our framework is available as an open-source C++ library and has already been successfully applied in several robotics projects. We present a series of experimental results carried out with real robots and on publicly available real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to update the representation efficiently and models the data consistently while keeping the memory requirement at a minimum.},

@article{Milella2011,
abstract = {Ground segmentation is critical for a mobile robot to successfully accomplish its tasks in challenging environments. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised radar-vision classification system that allows an autonomous vehicle, operating in natural terrains, to automatically construct online a visual model of the ground and perform accurate ground segmentation. The system features two main phases: the training phase and the classification phase. The training stage relies on radar measurements to drive the selection of ground patches in the camera images, and learn online the visual appearance of the ground. In the classification stage, the visual model of the ground can be used to perform high level tasks such as image segmentation and terrain classification, as well as to solve radar ambiguities. The proposed method leads to the following main advantages: (a) a self-supervised training of the visual classifier, where the radar allows the vehicle to automatically acquire a set of ground samples, eliminating the need for time-consuming manual labeling; (b) the ground model can be continuously updated during the operation of the vehicle, thus making it feasible the use of the system in long range and long duration navigation applications. This paper details the proposed system and presents the results of experimental tests conducted in the field by using an unmanned vehicle.},

abstract = {Rotating radar sensors are perception systems rarely used in mobile robotics. This paper is concerned with the use of a mobile ground-based panoramic radar sensor which is able to deliver both distance and velocity of multiple targets in its surrounding. The consequence of using such a sensor in high speed robotics is the appearance of both geometric and Doppler velocity distortions in the collected data. These effects are, in the majority of studies, ignored or considered as noise and then corrected based on proprioceptive sensors or localization systems. Our purpose is to study and use data distortion and Doppler effect as sources of information in order to estimate the vehicle's displacement. The linear and angular velocities of the mobile robot are estimated by analyzing the distortion of the measurements provided by the panoramic Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, called IMPALA. Without the use of any proprioceptive sensor, these estimates are then used to build the trajectory of the vehicle and the radar map of outdoor environments. In this paper, radar-only localization and mapping results are presented for a ground vehicle moving at high speed.},

@article{Wang2013,
abstract = {DOA (Direction of Arrival) estimation is a major problem in array signal processing applications. Recently, compressive sensing algorithms, including convex relaxation algorithms and greedy algorithms, have been recognized as a kind of novel DOA estimation algorithm. However, the success of these algorithms is limited by the RIP (Restricted Isometry Property) condition or the mutual coherence of measurement matrix. In the DOA estimation problem, the columns of measurement matrix are steering vectors corresponding to different DOAs. Thus, it violates the mutual coherence condition. The situation gets worse when there are two sources from two adjacent DOAs. In this paper, an algorithm based on OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit), called ILS-OMP (Iterative Local Searching-Orthogonal Matching Pursuit), is proposed to improve DOA resolution by Iterative Local Searching. Firstly, the conventional OMP algorithm is used to obtain initial estimated DOAs. Then, in each iteration, a local searching process for every estimated DOA is utilized to find a new DOA in a given DOA set to further decrease the residual. Additionally, the estimated DOAs are updated by substituting the initial DOA with the new one. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.},

This paper addresses these problems by tying the SLAM system with a global loop closure detection approach, which intrinsically handles these situations. However, online processing for global loop closure detection approaches is generally influenced by the size of the environment. The proposed graph-based SLAM system uses a memory management approach that only consider portions of the map to satisfy online processing requirements. The approach is tested and demonstrated using five indoor mapping sessions of a building using a robot equipped with a laser rangefinder and a Kinect.},

abstract = {Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation plays a vital role in many applications. Beamforming is the most prominent technique to estimate DOA. In this survey, a study of various beamforming techniques and algorithms to estimate the direction of arrival of a signal is made. An assessment on the background robust algorithms using Nyquist sampling rate and its Compressive sensing alternative is done. It is known that Bearing estimation algorithms obtain only a small number of direction of arrivals (DOAs) within the entire angle domain, when the sources are spatially sparse. Hence, it may be concluded that, the methods those specifically exploits this spatial sparsity property is advantageous. These methods use a very small number of measurements in the form of random projections of the sensor data along with one full waveform recording at one of the sensors.},

The miniaturization and integration of the optical and electronic components used to build them have played a crucial role in the achievement of compactness, robustness and flexibility of the sensors. Today, several 3D sensors are available on the market, even in combination with other sensors in a " sensor fusion " approach. An importance equal to that of physical miniaturization has the portability of the measurements, via suitable interfaces, into software environments designed for their elaboration, e.g., CAD-CAM systems, virtual renders, and rapid prototyping tools. In this paper, following an overview of the state-of-art of 3D imaging sensors, a number of significant examples of their use are presented, with particular reference to industry, heritage, medicine, and criminal investigation applications.},

abstract = {During the past years, various research teams developed 60 GHz chipset solutions, using both advanced CMOS [1] and BiCMOS [2] technologies. But for the 60 GHz market to flourish not only low cost RFICs are required, low cost antennas and packages are also key elements. Recently, low cost High Density Interconnect (HDI) organic technology has been evaluated [3, 4] to develop 60 GHz module using antenna-in-package approach. Measured gain is in the order of 4 dBi but there is still a need to achieve higher gain in order to increase the transmit/receive range of the system. The use of a lens is an appealing solution since it enables to customize the system performances while using existing chipset solution. In this paper, we investigate the performances achievable by a plastic (ABS-M30) lens manufactured using low cost and rapid manufacturing 3D printing technology. Material properties at 60 GHz are reviewed, a preliminary 60 GHz lens design is detailed and the full system is validated using a WiGig wireless link (demonstrating a 10 dB improvement in the link budget in comparison with the system without lens).},

@phdthesis{Kunin2010,
abstract = {Localization of sources and the detection of objects using ultrasound has been the topic of a great deal of research as there are numerous applications for these techniques. Some of the prominent applications of sound source localization are the enhancement of human speech recognition for hands free man machine interface, the separation of multiple sound sources for teleconferencing and the detection and localization of mechanical or structural failures in vehicles and building or bridges. Ultrasound source detection can also be used for the above described applications as well as for a wide variety of security systems and for robotic vision. This work explores the fundamentals of sound and ultrasound source localization as well as ultrasound object imaging and matched filtering. The main parts of this work are the design of an acoustic chamber, measurement mound, and sensor arrays, the exploration of various sound and ultrasound acquisition systems, and the analysis of how the acquired data could be used for sound source and object detection. The acoustic chamber is used to create a clean environment which isolates the experiment from external noises and reduces reverberation. The measurement mount is used to accurately position the source. The sensor arrays are used to experiment with different geometries and with different numbers of sensors. The acquisition systems explored include a novel standalone field-programmable gate array (FPGA) micro-electro mechanical microphones (MEMS) array system and various acquisition systems consisting of independent circuits, components, and test equipment. The circuits considered are the microphone and ultrasound transducer amplification and filtering circuit. Pertinent modern test equipment, such as digital oscilloscopes and arbitrary waveform generators, xii and their features which are related to acquisition and generation of data are also explained. This work concludes by discussing how several sound and ultrasound localization, matched filtering, and ultrasound imaging experiments were conducted and what the results of those experiments were.},

@article{Sarbolandi2015,
abstract = {Recently, the new Kinect One has been issued by Microsoft, providing the next generation of real-time range sensing devices based on the Time-of-Flight (ToF) principle. As the first Kinect version was using a structured light approach, one would expect various differences in the characteristics of the range data delivered by both devices. This paper presents a detailed and in-depth comparison between both devices. In order to conduct the comparison, we propose a framework of seven different experimental setups, which is a generic basis for evaluating range cameras such as Kinect. The experiments have been designed with the goal to capture individual effects of the Kinect devices as isolatedly as possible and in a way, that they can also be adopted, in order to apply them to any other range sensing device. The overall goal of this paper is to provide a solid insight into the pros and cons of either device. Thus, scientists that are interested in using Kinect range sensing cameras in their specific application scenario can directly assess the expected, specific benefits and potential problem of either device.},

abstract = {In the present work the performance of a low-cost ultrasonic rangefinder system exploiting linear chirp excitation signal and the Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave technique is analyzed, evaluated in terms of resolution and computational cost , and compared with the results achievable by means of the standard technique based on the matched-filter theory. The system, based on a Voltage Controlled Oscillator and an analog mixer, shifts some of the processing required by the FMCW protocol in the analog domain, strongly relaxing the requirements on the signal sampling rate without reducing the achievable range resolution. The final target is to evaluate the possibility of implementing the FMCW technique in very low cost and hand held devices.},
