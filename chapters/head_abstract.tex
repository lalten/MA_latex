    Mobile indoor robots mostly rely on lidar and vision sensors to remotely detect obstacles in their path. These sensors have trouble detecting some common real-world obstacles like transparent surfaces and chair legs. Recent affordable near-range miniature radar sensors enable new solutions.
    This thesis explores a simple solution for a radar sensor being moving through a static environment without the need for beamforming or a mechanically scanning radar. The idea is put to test in experiments with an Omniradar FMCW radar mounted on a Kobuki robot platform. A comparison against lidar and RGBD sensors shows how promising the setup is for navigation in unstructured environments.
